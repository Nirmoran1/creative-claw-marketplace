## What You Get

### MCP Server (auto-connected)

One connection to Creative Claw's MCP server gives you 18+ tools for media generation, editing, and asset management:

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| **Image** | `generate_image`, `edit_image`, `generate_image_variants`, `load_image` |
| **Video** | `generate_video`, `check_video_job`, `remove_video_background` |
| **Speech** | `generate_speech` |
| **3D** | `generate_3d_model`, `check_3d_model_job` |
| **Models** | `list_models`, `get_model_params` |
| **Assets** | `search_assets`, `update_asset`, `upload_asset`, `delete_asset`, `confirm_upload`, `get_upload_url` |
| **Branding** | `get_theme`, `list_themes`, `update_theme`, `delete_theme` |

Access 1,000+ production-ready AI models — FLUX, Gemini, Veo, Sora, Kling, Seedance, Hailuo, HeyGen, Recraft, ElevenLabs, and more — through a single unified account with usage-based pricing.

### Skills (Creative Workflows)

Skills are prompt-based workflows that teach Claude *how* to use the tools effectively — model selection, prompt engineering, multi-step production pipelines.

| Skill | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **image-generation** | Helps you pick the right model, craft effective prompts, and generate or edit images. Covers 6 recommended models with detailed reference guides. |
| **video-generation** | Guides you through model selection, reference image generation, camera direction, multi-segment video production, and talking avatars. Covers 9 recommended models with detailed reference guides. |
| **brand-theme** | Manages brand themes — save logos, colors, fonts, and style preferences. Extract brand elements from websites. Themes are used by image and video skills for consistent branding. |

Each skill includes per-model reference files with prompting best practices, parameter tables, example prompts, and comparison guidance.

## Install

### Claude Code

```bash
# 1. Add the marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add CreativeClawCo/creative-claw-marketplace

# 2. Install the plugin
claude plugin install creative-claw@creative-claw-marketplace

# 3. Authenticate — on first use, the MCP server will prompt you to sign in via Clerk OAuth
```

That's it. The plugin connects to Creative Claw's MCP server and gives you access to all generation tools + the `/create-image` and `/create-video` skills.

### Claude Desktop

Add to your MCP config (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "creative-claw": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://app.creativeclaw.co/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

No API keys needed — auth is handled via Clerk OAuth on first connection.

## Quick Start

Just talk to Claude naturally:

```
"Generate a product photo of my headphones on a marble surface, golden hour lighting"
  -> image-generation skill picks the best model, crafts the prompt, generates

"Make a 15-second cinematic video of coffee being poured in slow motion"
  -> video-generation skill recommends Hailuo-02 Pro for physics, generates reference image, then video

"Edit this image — change the background to a beach sunset, keep the person unchanged"
  -> routes to an edit model, preserves identity, swaps background

"I need a TikTok-style product video for this shoe" [attach image]
  -> generates reference frames, picks an I2V model, produces the clip
```

## Architecture

```
You -> Claude + Skills (model selection, prompt engineering, creative direction)
              |
         MCP Tools (generate_image, generate_video, edit_image, ...)
              |
       Creative Claw Server (fal.ai + R2 storage + Clerk auth)
              |
       Permanent media URLs (never expire)
```

**No API keys.** No CLI wrappers. No expiring URLs. Just skills + MCP.
